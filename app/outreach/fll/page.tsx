              This past year Team 303 has re-established 12 FLL Explore teams in
              our local elementary schools to connect with our youth on a deeper
              level and instill FIRST ideals within younger students.

            <p className="font-light text-ms">
              Each week, mentors went to each school and helped guide the
              students through the FLL Explore Curriculum. Then, 303 went above
              and beyond by making fun FLL-style challenges for the students to
              accomplish. Students are left happy and excited for future FIRST
              opportunities every week.

              This past year Team 303 has established 16 new teams that will
              participate in the Middle School Technology Design
              Challenge(MSTDC). Leading up to the challenge, the team mentors
              the students as they design, build, and program.

            <p className="font-light text-ms">
              Each week, the team visits the local Middle School, leading
              students through the engineering design process, in various
              challenges such as Sumo and Football Throw. Team 303 helps to host
              the event at the local Middle School. Schools from surrounding
              districts attend with their teams for a fun competition.

              During build season, team 303 brought an FTC robot to one of their
              local intermediate schools, where the team gave students the
              opportunity to drive the robot, giving them a glimpse of FIRST and
              robotics at a higher level. On top of that, the team also hosted
              different STEAM related activities, such as bridge-building,
              marble runs, and programming challenges.

              Team 303 reached out to one of their local elementary schools,

              school weekly, planning and running several engineering, design,
              and programming activites. The team later expanded on this
              program, reaching out to three schools in their district and
              starting 28 new LEGO robotics teams.
